    "San Francisco is a notoriously expensive location for individuals and businesses alike. Median rent prices were \\\\$3,500 a month in January 2020 and median home price was \\\\$1.3 million, far above the national medians of \\\\$1,200 and \\\\$285,000, respectively (source: Zillow for rent price, Trullia for housing price). Business Insider reports that, to buy a home in San Francisco, one would need to earn \\\\$303,000 a year."

    "San Francisco's high cost of living is due to its proximity to Silicon Valley. As a result, the high expenses have not discouraged tech employees from living in or in areas close to San Francisco. With this in mind, what are the business prospects for a company looking to locate itself in this expensive city by the bay? Although San Francisco is a relatively compact city compared to others in America, there are still 27 zip codes in San Francisco County (which exclusively covers the city of San Francisco and very close communities in the bay)."

    "The goal of this project is to analyze the various neighborhoods in San Francisco to see what types of venues are present in order to assess which neighborhood would be most ideal for starting a new business. The Foursquare API will be used to gather information about theses venues. The justification for using venue data is that if there are a larger number of businesses, especially those that are doing well in a neighborhood, the greater the chance that there is a thriving neighborhood with prospective clients interested in becoming customers at a new, service-based business. As such, our <b> main audience </b> for this report will be prospective <b>service-based</b> businesses such as restaurants, coffee shops, or retail stores. While the presence of similar venues may signal increased competition, it also signals greater potential for customers as well. "

The quality of these venues suggested by the tips system will allow us to compile an overall score based on the number and quality of venues that will be used to compare the neighborhoods and their potential as new business locations. Maps visualizing the location of the top venues in each neighborhood will also be provided as a means of assessing the proximity of these venues to each other. This density of  venues can also be crucial for analysis, as closer proximity venues suggests more potential customers in each location."

    "\n",
    "The [San Francisco link](https://www.zipdatamaps.com/san-francisco-ca-county-zipcodes) has all the zip codes listed for San Francisco county, which covers the city and a few limited surrounding areas. We dropped any zip code that did not have population values associated with it. Each zip code link from the website also includes longitude and latitude coordinates as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> We chose to use zip codes instead of neighborhoods in San Francisco due to the fact that San Francisco's neighborhoods are not well-defined. There are more than [110+ neighborhoods in San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_San_Francisco), many overlapping and redundant, making analysis with neighborhoods difficult. In contrast, since zip codes are defined by distance from a geographical center, the areas defined by zip codes are distinct and therefore easier to analyze.\n",

    "We used the Foursquare API to get a list of the top venues in each zip code. We selected for the top 100 venues in each zip code and then performed a manual analysis of the top five venues in each zip code. A cursory glance of the data seemed to indicate that food and drink venues such as restaurants, bars, and coffee shops are extremely common in the city.\n",

    "The findings seem to indicate that San Francisco has a large number of food and drink venues, which are clustered in the northeastern part of the city. This appears to indicate that this region of the city would be the best for a new business to be located, which is perhaps unsurprising as this is the location of San Francisco's Financial District and Downtown. \n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation seems to be clear given the limit scope of our analysis. The best place to locate a new business would be in the northeastern part of the city, roughly corresponding to zip codes 94102, 94103, 94108, and 94109. As mentioned earlier, these zip codes roughly correspond to San Francisco's Financial District and Downtown, which are filled with corporate headquarters and existing service businesses, making it ideal for a new service-based business to be located in San Francisco."

    "\n",
    "The findings themselves in this project are perhaps not surprising, as it suggests that the best location for a new business would be in relatively wealthy and densely crowded parts of San Francisco, the Financial District and Downtown. With that being said, it is necessary also to consider the cost of real estate in these locations, a consideration that was not taken into account in this particular report. While it may be too expensive for a brand new business to locate itself within the confines of these zip codes itself, it is perhaps prudent to consider locating a business on the outer edges of these zip codes in order to benefit from a reasonably high level of customers and customer incomes while benefiting from somewhat lower cost of entry."
